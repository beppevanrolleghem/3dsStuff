# I don't have a name yet

this game is supposed to be a minigame collection type of deal like wario ware. at this time i've started to set it that the game is played on both screens at the same time, making both easy games a lot harder. 

# todo

-menu's
-interactivity between the games (shared lives, and shared resets)
-more games
